### Hey, I'm Cooper! 👋

I'm a 16 year-old self-taught software developer.

## ⭐️ Present

I'm currently doing a remote software development internship. It's a fantastic learning experience and I'm learning a lot of things about the professional software development process, as well as specific languages, frameworks, and other technologies that I'm using to build my internship project(s). 

## 📚 Experience

I like to say that I'm full-stack, but I especially enjoy the world of backend development in Node/TypeScript. I'm currently learning Golang and I'm excited to officially add that to my skillset after more practice and experience with it.
