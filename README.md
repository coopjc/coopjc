### Hey, I'm Cooper! 👋

I'm a 17 year-old self-taught software developer.

## ⭐️ Present

I'm currently doing a remote software development internship. I'm learning a lot about the professional software development process, as well as specific languages, frameworks, and other technologies that I'm using to build my internship project(s). I'm also currently working on a personal project in React/Golang.

## 📚 Experience

I am capable of full-stack development, but I really enjoy the world of backend development in Node and Golang. I also plan on moving into Rust, Kotlin, or Elixir eventually.
