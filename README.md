### Hey, I'm Cooper! 👋

I'm a 16 year-old self-taught software developer.

## ⭐️ Present

I'm currently doing a remote software development internship. It's a fantastic learning experience and I'm learning a lot about the professional software development process, as well as specific languages, frameworks, and other technologies that I'm using to build my internship project(s). 

## 📚 Experience

I've been interested in computers and technology from a very young age and I've been I've been building my programming and software development skills for the past 5 years. I have experience in fullstack development, but I especially enjoy the world of backend development in Node/TypeScript and Golang.
